# Project Overview

This is a backend API that integrates with two other APIs for data aggregation, focusing on reliability, performance, maintainability, and scalability. Key features include parallel API calls using multithreading, retry logic with Polly, in-memory caching, centralized error handling, and structured logging with Serilog.
