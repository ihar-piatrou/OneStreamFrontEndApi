# Code Analysis

Given the following:

```csharp
class Animal
{
    public virtual string speak(int x) { return "silence"; }
}

class Cat : Animal
{
    public string speak(int x) { return "meow"; }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public string speak(short x) { return "bow-wow"; }
}
```

### Question: 
Explain why the block below does not emit "bow-wow":

```csharp
Animal d = new Dog();
Console.Write(d.speak(0));
```

### Explanation:

The code snippet does not emit "bow-wow" because of how method overloading, method hiding, and inheritance work in C#.

1. **Method Overloading vs. Method Hiding**: 
   - In the `Animal` class, there is a `speak(int x)` method marked as `virtual`, which means it is intended to be overridden by derived classes.
   - In the `Dog` class, there is a `speak(short x)` method, which has a different parameter type (`short` instead of `int`). This means that the `Dog` class is *not* overriding the `speak(int x)` method but rather *overloading* it with a different signature.
   - In C#, method overloading depends on the number and type of parameters, and the runtime resolution will choose the appropriate method based on the argument type.

2. **Polymorphism and Virtual Method Resolution**: 
   - The reference `d` is of type `Animal` but holds an instance of `Dog`. This means that when `d.speak(0)` is called, the C# runtime will try to resolve the method call using the `Animal` class, since the reference type is `Animal`.
   - The `Animal` class has the method `speak(int x)`, which returns "silence". Since `Dog` did not override the `speak(int x)` method, the virtual dispatch mechanism will use the base class's version of the method, which returns "silence".

3. **Argument Matching**:
   - The `speak(0)` method call passes an `int` value (`0`). This matches the method in the `Animal` class (`speak(int x)`), not the overloaded version in the `Dog` class (`speak(short x)`).
   - The `Dog` class has a `speak(short x)` method, but since the argument type is `int` (not `short`), it does not match. The runtime will therefore use the version of `speak` that matches the argument type, which is the base class's `speak(int x)`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Because the reference is of type `Animal`, and `Dog` did not override the `speak(int x)` method, the call `d.speak(0)` resolves to the base class method `Animal.speak(int x)`, resulting in "silence" being printed.

### How to Fix It to Emit "bow-wow":

To make the code emit "bow-wow", you need to correctly override the `speak` method in the `Dog` class. You can do this by making sure that the `Dog` class overrides the virtual method in `Animal`:

```csharp
class Dog : Animal
{
    public override string speak(int x) { return "bow-wow"; }
}
```

Alternatively, if you want to keep the `short` parameter, you could change the method call to explicitly use a `short` argument:

```csharp
Animal d = new Dog();
Console.Write(d.speak((short)0));  // Outputs: "bow-wow"
```

In both cases, you ensure that the appropriate `speak` method in the `Dog` class is called, resulting in "bow-wow" being printed.
